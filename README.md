# Course Statistics Application
 This application provides statistical data on courses offered over the last five academic years, specifically from the 2019 Fall term to the 2024 Spring term. It processes data from Excel files and stores it in efficient data structures for quick querying and analysis. The main goal is to offer insights into course performance, including success and failure rates, average GPAs, and other relevant metrics.
